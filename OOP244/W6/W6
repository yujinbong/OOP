Workshop #6: Classes and resources, IO operators
version 1.1 (added tester output for part 2 and fixed a bug in main.cpp part 1)
version 1.2 (removed irrelevant instruction in data entry)
In this workshop, you will implement a class with overloaded constructors. Then you will overload IO operators that will be used to read and write on the screen and files.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

define and implement multiple constructors
define and implement the rule of three
Read formatted data using istream
Write formatted data using ostream
Overload the extraction and insertion operators for I/O, using iostream
