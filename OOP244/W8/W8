Workshop #8: Virtual functions and Abstract base classes
In this workshop, you will create a hierarchy of classes to practice and understand the role of virtual functions in inheritance. The workshop consists of 4 classes:

Shape; encapsulates a shape that can be drawn on the screen
(An interface, that is an abstract base class with only pure virtual functions)
LblShape; encapsulates a shape that can be labelled
(An abstract base class that represents a labelled shape)
Line; encapsulates a horizontal line on a screen with the label
(this concrete class draws a labelled line)
Rectangle; encapsulates a rectangle on the screen that can be labelled
(this concrete class draws a rectangle with a label inside).
Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

define pure virtual functions
create abstract base classes
implement behaviour using virtual functions
explain the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class
describe what you have learned in completing this workshop
